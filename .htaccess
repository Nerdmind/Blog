# This file contains the configuration rules for the Apache HTTP server. It is #
# recommended to include these rules directly into the Apache configuration!   #
#                                                                              #
# Additionally, it's recommended to ensure that the AllowOverride directive is #
# disabled if these rules are included in the Apache configuration. Otherwise, #
# the Apache HTTP server is checking for .htaccess files on every request.     #
#                                                                              #
# AllowOverride None                                                           #
