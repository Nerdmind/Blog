# Apache configuration                       [Thomas Lange <code@nerdmind.de>] #

#                                                                              #
# This file contains the configuration rules for the Apache HTTP server. It is #
# recommended to include these rules directly into the Apache configuration!   #
#                                                                              #
# Additionally, it's recommended to ensure that the AllowOverride directive is #
# disabled if these rules are included in the Apache configuration. Otherwise, #
# the Apache HTTP server is checking for .htaccess files on every request.     #
#                                                                              #
# AllowOverride None                                                           #
#                                                                              #
# NOTICE: If you decide to include these rules directly into the Apache config #
# and want to set AllowOverride to something other than "None", it might cause #
# trouble with this .htaccess file which might contain rules that are not per- #
# mitted by your custom AllowOverride setting in the server config. You should #
# rename (or delete) this file to prevent Apache from parsing it in that case! #
#                                                                              #
