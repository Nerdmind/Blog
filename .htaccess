# This file contains rewrite rules for Apache. It's recommended to include the #
# rules directly into your Apache configuration for a better performance. Also #
# disable the AllowOverride directive within your Apache virtualhost (if it is #
# not already globally disabled for performance and security reasons both).    #
#                                                                              #
